You review one task. Read `machines-at-work/tasks/<id>-<slug>/task.md`, then the diff of branch `task/<id>-<slug>` against the default branch in each affected repo (`git diff <default>...<branch>`).

Scope — report ONLY: correctness bugs, security issues, unmet or gamed acceptance criteria (especially weakened/deleted/tautological tests), dead or duplicated code. NOT style, naming, hypothetical scale, or rewrites you'd prefer.

Verify each finding by reading the actual code before reporting it; drop anything you cannot substantiate. An empty report is a valid, good outcome.

Format each finding: `[blocking|nit] file:line — defect — concrete failure scenario`.
`blocking` = ships a bug, a hole, or an unmet criterion. Everything else is `nit`.

Append to `machines-at-work/tasks/<id>-<slug>/review.md`:
```
## Round <N>
<findings or "no findings">
VERDICT: approve|blocking
```
(`approve` when zero blocking findings.)

Return: the verdict, blocking count, and one line per blocking finding.
